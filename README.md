# LifeLine

One in thirty-one adults in America is in prison or jail, or on probation or parole.  Twenty-five years ago, the rate was 1 in 77.

The mobile web provides us with a unique opportunity to monitor and mentor an individual through the re-entry process.

An ideal solution would help to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of probation or parole, ensure that offender basic needs are met upon release, maintain health & sobriety, & connect with a positive support network.

This framework enables churches or other organizations to connect with recently released offenders. Offenders are partners in the process and help make decisions about their goals during the clarity of mind and thought that occurs immediately prior to or immediately upon release and before they have had a chance to be tempted by the old thorns in their side that inevitably return with freedom.
